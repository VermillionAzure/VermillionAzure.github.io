## Overview

*The problem:* There exists no good web app to create your own casual
competitive community or club with ratings (e.g. chess club with ELO,
online game with game-supported points system and API).

*The solution:* ***Legendary*** is a MeteorJS customizable application to
provide an online platform for clubs with rating systems.

### Why should I use it?

- Slack, Discord, Reddit, and online forums lack first-class integration
  for club-specific rating systems or club-specific functionality. 

- Integration with other account systems for validation can be used
  (for example, the UH login system).

- Clubs that currently don't have official websites can easily adapt to
  it (e.g. the League of Legends club here at UH Manoa).

## Mockup page ideas

- Login
- Leaderboard
- Profile
- Page Creation
- Forum
- Form Post Creation
- Page Editing Screen


## Use case ideas

- Users will be able to signup for the community (with UH ID availiable)
- Can interact with other accounts if APIs are supplied for pulling
  ratings/points (e.g. rank on onlinego.com, rank on DOTA2).
- Users will be able to see a home screen that shows a leaderboard of
  users in the community.
- Users will be able to setup basic pages in Markdown that can be added
  to the top navigation bar.
- Users will be able to see their own profile (and possibly customize it).
- Users will be able to upload their own profile picture.
- Users will be able to create their own community, and be added as Owner.
- Owners can add other Owners, and also Admins.
- Admins can give permissions to users to see certain pages.
- Users will be able to provide a CSS stylesheet to style their profiles
  or pages.

## Beyond the basics

- Integration with Slack as a page.
- Integration with Facebook or Google accounts
- Embedding of videos
- Customized module system (like Trello add-ons).
