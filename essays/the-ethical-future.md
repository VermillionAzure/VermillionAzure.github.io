***Online harassment.*** *Cyberbullying.* Despite the amount of campaigning
against online harassment for minors and how children can be driven to
depression or worse because of the way we can treat each other online, for
many, it is not quite real for many, simply because people do not believe that 
online interactions could not possibly be as impactful as real-life ones.

**But harassment can bleed into the professional world as well.** 
[Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy) and 
[SWAT-ing/swatting](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/the-serial-swatter.html)
are two clear examples of when the actions of bullies and criminals online can 
lead to things that have very real consequences -- companies intimidated out of 
showing up to professional conferences, and people can leave behind 
professions and decades of experience.

When lives are broken and lost due to what people can accomplish within a system 
(namely, here, the Internet and the technologies that are created using it), is 
that the fault of the manufacturers? The government? The engineers? Surely, one 
needs to think about what is possible when one designs a product or a system. 
**But ethics doesn't seem to be on first on any list for a lot of people.**

Start from the schools: ethics tends to be a senior or junior-level class in 
many schools, not just my school, UH Manoa. If you look at curriculums from UC 
Berkeley or Georgia Tech, ethics and, especially, ethical and safe design is not 
introduced until later. Design with consideration for correctness of an 
algorithm? That's clearly taught across the world. Design with consideration for 
ethical and social impact? That's a topic that's not taught in-depth with theory 
and methodology for producing ethical systems and programs.

If you move into industry, usually, companies do not change their ways until 
they are sued. It takes major events like killing multiple people in cancer 
treatment with the Therac-25 or the Ariene 5 European Space Agency rocket 
blowing up and wasting millions of dollars until someone in industry decides 
"safety is our first priority." It seems that companies tend to be reactionary 
-- it is rare to see a free-standing company that places moral and ethical
behavior and design at an extremely-high priority when it's *not* directly 
related to customer trust or business.

**If a truely ethical future is to be achieved, it must be taught and 
practiced, not just put on as an afterthought.**
