HTML, CSS, and JS are sometimes occasionally referred to as "The Unholy Trinity" of
web development due to their importance. Together, they form the basis of most (if not all?)
front-end development and interface design of web development.

As a part of the ICS 314 class, we've had to learn these three as we've begun to
interact with our first front-end framework, [Semantic UI](https://www.semantic-ui.com/).

Now, I think that the idea of having reusable components is nice. Being able to
use CSS as decorators onto the Document Object Model (DOM) and then being able to compose
them is nice.

I think that, like all abstractions, leaky ones are not perfect. CSS is not completely
composable if you have classes downstream that can modify some of the critical spacings or
values that make Semantic UI UI look unified. Accidentally changing the effects on something
like a menu without keeping the look/feel consistent, but just in a slightly different flavor
to one's taste can be a bit hard (e.g. the mouse-over color for menu links).

Another thing is that I simply think that I'm too inexperienced with front-end development
to be able to formulate a well-informed opinion on it. Despite all the hype about how web
development may move too fast and that there's too much diversity within the front-end
development ecosystem, the tooling and development process is superior in testing and speed
to raw development in, say, C. The web browser as a debugger and instant validator is
a huge plus to front-end development in general.

I am hungry to try React and Angular, however, simply because they're well known and used
by Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc. Surely, the front-end frameworks are so popular because
they support really good features.

Another thing I want to understand is how 3D and specialized 2D graphics/interaction can
occur in the browser. The HTML 5 canvas element and the ability to put HTML 5 games
in the browser is a testament to the power and expressiveness of web browsers today. The
ability to use AJAX to essentially build a service or program interface in the browser itself
is really powerful -- I am looking forward into diving into these tech at some point,
since I am interested in stuff like d3.js.
