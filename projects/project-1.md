The Transpiler Project was a senior Computer Engineering project at the
University of Hawai'i at Manoa to create a Scheme interpreter.

The project's technical and design aspects are entirely student-run.

I started this project in order to get more hands-on programming
language theory experience. The codebase is in C++11, and represents
my largest independent work within my hobbyist language of choice.

I managed 8-13 people over the course of the project, and led the
project's management and design. I guided teams of sophomores
during the first semester with little to no C++ experience, as well
as more experienced juniors and seniors later into the 2-3 semesters
of the project.

Our original code was too unfocused, but our current code is based
off of R. Kent Dybvig's disseration [Three Implementation Models for Scheme](http://www.cs.unc.edu/xcms/wpfiles/dissertations/dybvig.pdf);
Over the project, our design and management skills have grown from
dealing with makeshift build/test systems and 3 consecutive redesigns
to using CMake/Google Test and basing our work on an official langauge
standard in addition to research already present in the field.
