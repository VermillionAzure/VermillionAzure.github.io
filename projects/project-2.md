Over the course of 10 weeks in Summer 2016, I and 5 other people developed a
virtual reality application in Unity to replicate the experience of the
Attack of Pearl Harbor as experienced from Ford Island.

Over the course of this internship, I was able to get experience designing
sound for the experience in FL Studio and Adobe Audition. Additionally,
I got experience in 3D modeling with Blender, and helped create a model of
Ford Island from geographic information system (GIS) data.

Unlike other software development internships, this was classified as a
"Systems Delivery" project in Booz Allen Hamilton. This means that while
the entire team was not working on software development-intensive work,
the team was ultimately working on a single end-product and participating
in the consulting process, with business meetings with clients and actively
working together to get project requirements from the client.

I also got design experience in presenting and delivering both team and
individual idea pitches to executives and management members of Booz Allen
Hamilton. I personally value the experience I got here with presenting with
more business-minded people very highly.
