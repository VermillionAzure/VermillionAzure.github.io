Over the course of 10 weeks in Summer 2016, I and 5 other people developed a
virtual reality application in Unity to replicate the experience of the
Attack of Pearl Harbor as seen and experienced from Ford Island.

Over the course of this internship, I was able to get experience designing
sound for the experience in FL Studio and Adobe Audition. Additionally,
I got experience in 3D modeling with Blender, and helped create a model of
Ford Island from geographic information system (GIS) data.

I also got design experience in presenting and delivering both team and
individual idea pitches to executives and management members of Booz Allen
Hamilton.
