In my 1st summer in college and going into my 2nd year, I developed a prototype
for a web application that was meant to serve non-technical biologists to allow
them to create and run data processing workflows for single cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) data analysis.

Over the course of the project, I was exposed to my first experience in
software development and also got my first exposure to research.

If you want to check out the non-prototype, finished application, see [here](http://ilab.hawaii.edu:8109/?_state_id_=5d8c45acabd6036d&tab=uep).
